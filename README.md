# Learning Notes -  Implementing Data Structures in C/C++

This repository contains implementations of various data structures in C and some in C++. The main goal of this repository is to serve as a learning resource and a personal reference. The code works but might not be perfect, and the memory deallocation methods are not always included for simplicity.

## Introduction

This repository is created for educational purposes, providing implementations of different data structures in C and C++. The primary focus is on understanding how these data structures work. While the code aims to be functional, it is not optimized for production use.

## Implemented Data Structures
